# HandyWriterz: Phase 4 Todo List

This document outlines the tasks for the next phase of development, focusing on the foundational enhancements outlined in the `gemini.md` file.

## 1. Advanced Memory and Personalization

-   [ ] **Implement Long-Term Memory:**
    -   [ ] Design a database schema for storing long-term memories.
    -   [ ] Create a `LongTermMemory` node that can store and retrieve memories.
    -   [ ] Integrate the `LongTermMemory` node into the main agent graph.
-   [ ] **Enhance Writing Fingerprint:**
    -   [ ] Add argumentation style and rhetorical device analysis to the `MemoryWriter` node.
    -   [ ] Update the user's writing fingerprint with the new metrics.
-   [ ] **Implement Personalized Recommendations:**
    -   [ ] Create a `Recommendation` node that generates personalized recommendations based on the user's writing fingerprint.
    -   [ ] Display the recommendations to the user in the frontend.

## 2. Swarm Intelligence V2

-   [ ] **Implement Dynamic Swarm Configuration:**
    -   [ ] Create a `SwarmConfig` object that defines the configuration for a swarm.
    -   [ ] Update the `MasterOrchestrator` to dynamically create swarms based on the task requirements.
-   [ ] **Implement Hierarchical Swarms:**
    -   [ ] Design a hierarchical swarm architecture with high-level and low-level swarms.
    -   [ ] Implement the communication protocol between the different levels of the hierarchy.
-   [ ] **Develop Inter-Swarm Communication Protocol:**
    -   [ ] Create a robust and efficient protocol for sharing information between swarms.
    -   [ ] Implement the protocol in the `BaseNode` class so that all agents can use it.

## 3. UI/UX Enhancements

-   [ ] **Improve the Chat Interface:**
    -   [ ] Add support for rich text formatting in the chat input.
    -   [ ] Implement a more intuitive way to display the agent's thought process and progress.
-   [ ] **Create a "Memory" Dashboard:**
    -   [ ] Design a dashboard that allows users to view and manage their writing fingerprint.
    -   [ ] Provide visualizations of the user's writing style and how it has evolved over time.
-   [ ] **Enhance the Study Circle Feature:**
    -   [ ] Add support for private messaging within a study circle.
    -   [ ] Implement a system for sharing and collaborating on documents in real-time.
